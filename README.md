# Is today a public holiday in Sweden?

This is a simple web app that tells you if today is a public holiday in Sweden. It uses the [Nager.Date](https://github.com/nager/Nager.Date) API to get the data.

Please, if you are an employer, feel free to look at it. I just want to make it clear that [is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even) and [is-is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-is-even) is used as a joke. Looking for something more serious? Go back and look at other stuff I have published. ðŸ’š

## Background

This project is a part of a course in [Flerplattformsapplikationer med webbtekniker](https://mau-webb.github.io/resurser/da395a-vt24/) at [MalmÃ¶ University](https://mau.se/). For the full instructions, see [GitHub Pages for the course](https://mau-webb.github.io/resurser/da395a-vt24/vg-assignment/) (in Swedish).

I wanted to create a simple web app that tells you if today is a public holiday in Sweden. The project was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

We were required to build a web app that uses an API to get data, and use two packages.

### Web API

The API used in this project is the [Nager.Date](https://github.com/nager/Nager.Date) API. It provides data about public holidays in different countries.

### Packages

The two packages used in this project are:

- [is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even) - A package that tells you if a number is even or not.
- [is-is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-is-even) - A package that tells you if a given function is the same as the is_even function from the is-even npm package.

These packages were used to demonstrate how to use npm packages in a project. This choice was clearly made as a joke, as the packages are not very useful. ðŸ¤ª
